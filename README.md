In this project, video detection system is being used for pedestrian counting.People counting is possible with the help of computer vision
technologies.The frames is extracted from the video and process with the help of image processing algorithm. The video-based pedestrian counting system is being developed on the Google Colaboratory along with the OpenCV development tools.
