# Pedestrian-Detection-and-Segmentation-From-Video
In this project, video detection system is being used for pedestrian counting. With the used of
an overhead or surveillance camera, people counting is possible with the help of computer vision
technologies. A video is process by a robust and adaptive algorithm which is developed for excellent
counting accuracy. Then the frame is extracted from the video and process with the help of
image processing algorithm. The video-based pedestrian counting system is being developed on the
Windows 10 platform with Microsoft Visual Studio along with the OpenCV development tools.
